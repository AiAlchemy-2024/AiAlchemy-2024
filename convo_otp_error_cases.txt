Customer:  Hi, I was trying to apply for a loan online, but I never received the OTP needed to proceed. Can you help me with this issue?  
Agent:  Hello! I’m really sorry to hear about the trouble you’ve faced. I’d be happy to assist you. Could you please provide me with your account number and the phone number you used for the application?  
Customer:  Sure, my account number is 123456789, and the phone number I used is 9876543210.  
   
 Agent:  Thank you for the details. Let me check your account and application status. This will just take a moment.  
   
 Customer:  Okay, thank you.  
   
 Agent:  I’ve checked your details, and it seems there might have been a technical issue with our system. I’m going to resend the OTP to your registered phone number. Can you please confirm if you receive it now?  
   
 Customer:  Alright, I’ll wait for it.

 Customer:  I still haven’t received the OTP. What should I do now?  
   
 Agent:  I apologize for the inconvenience. I will escalate this issue to our technical team. Meanwhile, could you please try restarting your phone and make sure you have a stable network connection? Sometimes this helps in receiving the OTP.  
   
 Customer:  I’ve already done that, but I’ll try again.
