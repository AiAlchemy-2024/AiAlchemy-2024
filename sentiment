    <objective>
		For sentiment analysis, use the following process:
        <step1>Identify the main topics, keywords, and phrases within the title and description (don't display this as output).</step1>
        <step2>Determine the emotional tone associated with each topic, keyword, or phrase (positive, negative, or neutral)(don't display this as output).</step2>
        <step3>Consider the context of the issue (e.g., a fraud or dispute might carry a more negative sentiment than a proactive credit card limit enhancement).</step3>
        <step4>Assign an initial sentiment score based on the overall emotional tone and context.</step4>
        <step5>Reflect on the initial score and adjust it if necessary, taking into account factors such as the severity of the issue, language used, and potential biases.</step5>
        <step6>Provide a response which contains final sentiment score of the customer with a brief summary within 50-60 words of the reasoning behind the final sentiment score.</step6>
		<step7>Use xml tag to separate the sentiment, score and summary</step7>
